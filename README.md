### Examples:

### Using tree-iteration-util

Allows iteration over tree structure nodes with ability to filter based on node class or node
attributes and ability to convert nodes to another type.

```java

```

output of above:

```text

```

### Motivation

I needed to iterate over markdown AST tree with ability to compute and/or collect information in
an efficient manner without the user of the code having to know intimate details of how to
traverse the AST tree to collect the required information.
